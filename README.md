# Final Project: Creation and Management of Databases


The final project for the second phase of the course consists of developing an application that allows analyzing information contained in a SQL database. This database will be later consulted though a Jupyter notebook and should be analyzed through graphs and tables to solve a problem. Within the requirements of the database created through SQL, is that it contains at least one view, one stored procedure and one function.
